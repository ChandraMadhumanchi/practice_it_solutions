/*
 	Partition a set into two subsets such that the difference of subset sums is minimum
    Returns minimum possible difference between sums
// of two subsets
  	 input = {2,3,4,5,6,7}
	 2 groups
	  
	  // [4,1,2]
	  // [4,1][2] -> 2.5, 2 -> | 2.5 - 2 | = 0.5
	  // [4][1,2] -> 4, 1.5 -> | 4 - 1.5 | = 2.5

	   Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.

		If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

		Example:
		
		Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
		Output: 1
		Explanation:
		Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
		Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11
